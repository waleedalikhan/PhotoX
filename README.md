# Tip.1

Always check your `code` when you get stuck in a problem.Cus maybe you should've wrote a line of code incorrectly or wrote a class or id with wrong spellings etc.

# Tip2(Pro tip)

If you are assured by re-checking your code over and over again without getting any error or spelling mistake then you should always use `Chrome Devtools` to find your problem before actually googling it.Cus you never know how much console.log errors you can get while using `JavaScript`.
So its always good to us `Chrome Devtools` if you're having problems in backend languages like `JavaScript`, `Dart`, `TypeScript` or any language which uses the `console` of the browser.Believe me you'll thank me later. :smirk:

# Tip3

If you're not getting any kind of error in your `code` or `Chrome Devtools` then you should `Google` it. But finding the solution to your problem by googling it is a skill. You can't find your solution everywhere on google. You have to search for it. And in my opinion the best place where you can find your solution based on coding(atleast I always got my solution there)is [ Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
